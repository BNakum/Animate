# Animate

Animate is a work-in-progress framework for creating declarative UIView animations. This framework is being created through a 2 part blog post, the **[first of which is available here](https://swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-declarative-animation-framework-in-swift-part-1)**.

Once both posts are published, this repo will be transformed into a proper framework which will also be available through CocoaPods & Carthage.
