# Animate

This branch contains a playground that was used to build the framework, which provides a declarative API for `UIView` animations. It was created through a 2-part blog post:

- [Part 1](https://swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-declarative-animation-framework-in-swift-part-1)
- [Part 2](https://swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-declarative-animation-framework-in-swift-part-2)

To follow the development of the framework, jump over to the [`master` branch](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Animate)
